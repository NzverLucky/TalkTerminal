# TalkTerminal
personnal project with only one server for now

If you don't receive all message or server isn't like new version (see your version in your "version.txt" (in your folder of your programm) and compare with version.txt in this github or if you want to be most fast, just start "update.exe" in your own folder.) 
But it's possible your computer don't want to downloads new or the version of this terminal. You just need to remove your antivirus

Commands : 
/seeuser : all user connected actually
/private : for talk in private with just one person (100% crypted)
/exit : for exit TalkTerminal
